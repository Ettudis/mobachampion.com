				"name" : "Desecrator",
				"reason" : "Desecrator is the king of crowd control. With a root, knockup/stun and silence, nobody can control the pace of a teamfight like Desecrator. He can jungle as a Hunter but exceeds in the Tactician role and is easily the best tank in the game."

				"name" : "Dibs",

				"name" : "Varion",
				"reason" : "Varion has a very accessible kit for a ranged carry and deals considerable physical damage using skill shots. His damage potential is massive, and the vision granted from Insight Shell and the mobility from Progress Gate gives him a nice safety net in lane."

				"name" : "Nissa",

				"name" : "Mikella",
				"reason" : "Mikella scales the best out of all of the physical carries in late game. However, her Waltz ability has a fairly short range and long cooldown making her a bit more vulnerable than the other ranged carries."

				"name" : "Raina",
				"reason" : "Raina is an absolute juggernaut when it comes to tanking. She offers a wide array of utility to her team, and is utterly unkillable. She performs well as a tactician, offering great protection to her allies, strong lane harass and a solid initiate at level 6 onwards."
			},
    		{
				"name" : "Fenmore",
				"reason" : "Fenmore is a very strong sustain mage that can bully most enemies in lane. He is arguably the best 1v2 Shaper in the game, but suffers a large weakness to Pain's Mortal Strike effect and can be easily shut down."

			{
				"name" : "Zeri",
				"reason" : "Zeri offers a lot of power to her allies. She has decent harass and lane damage, but it is her utility that makes her exceptionally strong. Her Muse and Prismatic Vortex will keep carries alive and dealing out tons of damage. She is also a direct counter to burst Shapers like Amarynth and Kindra. The recent addition of Blitz does make her a weaker pick against strong melee shapers."

			{
				"name" : "Cerulean",
				"reason" : "Cerulean's incredible initiation and peeling make him a very potent theat in lane. However, he is restricted to melee range and can be harassed in lane due to his long cooldowns."
			},
			{
				"name" : "Kindra",
				"reason" : "Kindra's high damage potential via resets is counter balanced by a fairly low amount of damage on her base abilities. She has decent sustain and shielding but is mostly forced into a passive playstyle waiting for kill opportunities. Once she gets going, she doesn't stop."

			{
				"name" : "Moya",
				"reason" : "She has the best mobility in the game, impressive life steal, impeccable clear speed and incredibly potent ganks at level 6. Her high skill cap does allow her to fall off late game, so she is not recommended for beginners."

				"name" : "Freia",
				"reason" : "Much like Voluc, Freia can clear through the jungle with ease and duel enemy Shapers into the ground.

			},
			{
				"name" : "Desecrator",
				"reason" : "Desecrator exceeds in the jungle due to his amazing crowd control. While his clear speed and damage is fairly low, his ganks have a high potential of netting kills and crowd control scales very well into late game."
			},			
			{
				"name" : "Kindra",
				"reason" : "While Kindra does not offer any crowd control, the resets on her Q/W/E abilities mean that ganks on duo lanes often result in multiple kills. Her kit also offers a lot of flexibility in tower dives."
