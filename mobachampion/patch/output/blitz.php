Reducing the immunity duration for ranged shapers will still allow them to block incoming disables with a clutch Blitz activation, but limit their ability to make guaranteed escapes or unstoppable offenses.</i><ul><li>The Crowd Control Immunity has been adjusted to differentiate between Ranged and Melee Shapers. Melee Shapers are now immune for 4 seconds, while Ranged Shapers are only immune for 2 seconds.</li></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 8 (August 09, 2013)</h4><i>Developer Note: Blitz is designed to support an aggressive playstyle against agile or disruptive enemies, allowing you to barrel straight through an opening volley of disabling effects, then run down a fleeing target; depending on the situation, it can also allow for a rapid retreat from those same threats. However, Blitz is not without its fair share of risk--unlike Dispel, it won't remove disables you're already suffering, so it requires you to predict your enemy's actions much more carefully. In addition, it does nothing to mitigate any incoming damage, and all the disable-immunity in the world won't make a difference if you're dead. Nonetheless, if you have the wits to spot perfect opportunity to strike, and the guts to seize it, Blitz can secure kills where no other spell can. Fortune favors the bold!</i><ul><li>(New Spell) This spell increases the player's movement speed by 30% for 8 seconds. In addition, for the first 4 seconds, all incoming disabling effects are negated.</li></ul>
