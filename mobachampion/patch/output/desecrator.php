Last week's patch notes have been edited to now include this change, and the change has been reiterated below. The removal of the magic resistance shred component of Desecrator's ultimate was intended to reduce the free damage he provided to his team; however, we did not want to lower the personal damage of his ultimate. To keep his ultimate's damage output at the same relative value it was before, we have increased its base damage to compensate for the removal of the MR shred. </i><ul><li><B>Desecrated Grounds (E)</B></li><ul><li>The base damage of this ability has been reduced to 75/125/175/225/275, down from 80/130/180/230/280.</li><li>The root duration of this ability has been reduced to 1.25 seconds, down from 1.5 seconds.</li><li>The persistent zone slow of this ability has been reduced to 30%, down from 35%.</li></ul><li><B>Death Fog (R)</B></li><ul><li>The percentage of max health damage component of this ability has been increased to 3/5/7%, up from 2.5/4.5/6.5%.</li></ul></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 7 (August 02, 2013)</h4><ul><li>Basic attack range increased to 130, up from 95.</li><li><B>Chilling Presence (W)</B></li><ul><li>The additional magic damage that this ability dealt with each basic attack that the Desecrator inflicted has been adjusted to 20/30/40/50/60, from 15/35/55/75</li></ul><li><B>Desecrated Ground (E)</B></li><ul><li>The base damage of this ability has been reduced to 80/130/180/230/280, down from 80/135/190/245/300.</li></ul><li><B>Death Fog (R)</B></li><ul><li>Removed the Magic Resist shred of this ability.
