Since assists are inherently worth less than Kills, this resulted in the change reducing the Predator reward from assists in two ways, resulting in the role getting lower than intended rewards from assists. The role will now provide a larger bonus from assists than from kills to offset this. While still providing less total vim from assists than when the role provided a static bonus, it should now be significantly more desirable to get an assist as a Predator.</i><ul><li>The bonus Vim and experience gained from scoring an assist on an enemy Shaper has been increased to 180% of normal value, up from 135% of the normal value. The bonus Vim and experience gained from killing an enemy Shaper remains at 135%.</li></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 8 (August 09, 2013)</h4><i>Developer Note: Previously, the Predator role gave full rewards for killing enemy shapers regardless of their score. This meant that Predators who were ahead could easily get further ahead by continuing to kill weak players on a death streak. By making the Predator's award based on a percentage of the amount of Vim (including Kill and death-streak modifications) for killing a shaper, Predators will now earn significantly less than before for killing players on death-streaks, and considerably more than before for killing players on kill-streaks.</i><ul><li>The amount of bonus Vim per kill and assist that this role gains has been changed to 135% bonus vim instead of a flat 100 vim.</li></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 3 (June 21, 2013)</h4><ul><li>Predators will now earn a total of 200% of the normal Vim gained from killing or being in the vicinity of a dying Spirit Well worker.</li></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 1 (June 06, 2013)</h4><ul><li>Amount of experience gained for shaper kills and assists has been increased to 130%, up from 125%.</li></ul>
