However, the fix for it is not yet ready for this patch. Additionally, we're continuing to keep a close eye on Sakari's performance at the competitive level. Currently, especially because of her high mechanical skill requirement, we're waiting to make an evaluation on if she needs larger changes or not until her performance at the highest levels of play stabilizes.</i><ul><li><b>Basic Attack</b></li><ul><li> Fixed a bug where Sakari's basic attack range was lower than intended. It has now been set to 550.</li></ul><li><b>Iceberg (W)</b></li><ul><li> This ability is no longer on smart cast by default.</li><li> This ability no longer triggers Binding aggro when used to force movement from an enemy Shaper.</li></ul><li><b>Avalanche (R)</b></li><ul><li> Fixed a bug where this ability would apply the incorrect slow percentage if used before Ice Lance (Q) was unlocked.</li><li> Fixed a bug where the secondary explosion of this ability would give trigger two stacks of Black Ice (Passive) if Sakari had the Vanguard passive from the Form item tree.</li></ul></ul>
