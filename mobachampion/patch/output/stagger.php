In addition, the slow duration at close range was giving players a little too much time to attacking the victim without having to spend time to close the gap. This change should mitigate both scenarios.</i><ul><li>The base damage of this ability has been reduced to 25~215, down from 40~230.</li><li>Minimum slow duration applied to targets that are in closer proximity to the caster has been reduced to 0.5 seconds, down from 1.</li></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 4 (July 14, 2013)</h4><i>Developer Note: Stagger has been changed to have its duration scale with distance from the target--distant foes are slowed longer, while nearby foes are slowed for a shorter duration. This change is to help Stagger further stand out as a strong initiation/chasing spell, as opposed to Wither's focus on turning the tide of close-range fights</i><ul><li>The duration of the slow from Stagger has been changed from a flat 2 second slow, to a 1-3 second slow depending on distance from affected target. It will act as a longer duration slow against a target hit by this ability at further range, and a shorter duration slow against a target hit by this ability at a shorter range.</li></ul><h4 style="color: #DAA520;">Closed Beta: Patch 3 (June 21, 2013)</h4><i>Developer Note: With Stagger, we wanted to give a powerful tool to aggressive Shapers that want to close in on a distant foe. Making good use of Stagger is a matter of waiting for the enemy's moment of weakness and exploiting it ruthlessly. While superficially similar to Wither, its longer range, shorter cooldown and stronger slow make it far more flexible as an initiation tool.</i>New Spell<ul><li>This new Spell fires a bolt of energy that blasts a target Shaper at long range, inflicting light magical damage and a applying a massive slow that deteriorates quickly over a short time.</li></ul>
