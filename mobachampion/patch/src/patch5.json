Kindra can excel in all portions of the early game, making both an effective Jungler and Laner. Kindra's built in survivability, both shielding and healing, make her an extremely daunting Shaper to fight in a duel or in a 2v2. Late game, Kindra's build tends to leave her susceptible to high burst or crowd control and encourages her to wait in the shadows while her team engages a fight. Choosing a low health target will ensure that Kindra gets the necessary ability resets to clean up any amount of foes. If Kindra's life is in danger, she can use her ultimate to briefly become untargetable as she damages and teleports between foes.</p><ul><li>Passive - Pure Shaper - Kindra is not limited by a resource and may cast her abilities freely.</li><li><B>Q - Night Strike</B> - Kindra fires several blades in a cone in front of her, dealing magical damage to all targets hit. Striking an enemy Shaper with this ability will cause Kindra to be healed when the blades return. This ability's cooldown resets if Kindra gets a kill or assist.</li><li><B>W - Duskmantle</B> - Kindra spins shadow blades in a short area around her, dealing magical damage to all targets hit. Striking an enemy Shaper with this ability will cause Kindra to gain a shield based on the number of Shapers hit. This ability's cooldown resets if Kindra gets a kill or assist.</li><li><B>E - Shadowstep</B> - Kindra instantly blinks behind her target, dealing magical damage if they are an enemy. This ability's cooldown resets if Kindra gets a kill or assist.</li><li><B>R - Nox Aeterna</B> - Kindra teleports a short distance to target enemy Shaper, becoming untargetable for a short duration while teleporting and dealing magical damage to multiple Shapers near her primary target. Multiple hits against the same target deal reduced damage.</li></ul>"
