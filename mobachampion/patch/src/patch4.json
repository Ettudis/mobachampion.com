Also introduced: the Shaper Gallery! A way to view Shapers Lore, Stats, and Abilities outside of the game! Enjoy, and happy playing!</p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7mzsjTk.jpg\">"

With this initial version we are introducing a matchmaking rating to everyone for the first time. Since there was no prior rating up until this point it will take several games before the system has an understanding of your skill level. Due to this, we ask that you please be patient and proactive about giving us feedback about the system and your experience.</i>"

However, Dispel can be a risky option compared to other defensive or utility spells: Bastion or Deflect might be enough to negate the damage you suffer while disabled, for example, or the superior mobility provided by Blink might allow you to avoid being disabled in the first place. Dispel is best used when you know you can't avoid an enemy with powerful disables, or when you know you'll only need a few steps of speed to reposition for a counterattack.</i>New Spell<ul><li>This new spell instantly remove all debuffs and disables (except suppression) from your shaper, and then reduce the duration of incoming disables for a short period afterward.
