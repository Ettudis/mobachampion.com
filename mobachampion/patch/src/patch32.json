			"id" : "general",
			"data" : "<p><h5>Basko, the Enforcer</h5><p>Basko is a melee, physical damage ability Bruiser who can combo and chain his abilities together to dominate his enemies. Basko excels most in the Hunter role, but can also succeed in lane as a Gladiator when paired with the right lane partner. Basko's core kit encourages prolonged scrapping - flowing correctly between Revolt and Basko's other abilities will guarantee high damage output over the course of a fight. Basko's passive and the on-hit portion of his core kit promote more diverse builds than the average Bruiser, and his built-in durability often allows these builds to succeed where other Shapers wouldn't. Basko is strongest in the early to mid-game, particularly in extended brawls - look to take big objectives early and force fights when possible. The resetting nature of Basko's ultimate gives him an incredible high-end damage and mobiltiy potential and make him the absolute best cleanup crew Bruiser in Dawngate.</p>"
